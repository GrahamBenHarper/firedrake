===========

When solving linear systems of equations as they arise for instance in the
finite-element method (FEM), one is often interested in *coupled* solutions of
more than one quantity. In fluid dynamics, a common example is solving a
coupled system of velocity and pressure as it occurs in some formulations of
the Navier-Stokes equations.
